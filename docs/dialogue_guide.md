# Planet Inhabitant Dialogue Guide - INDIRECT CONVERSATIONAL STYLE

## Core Principle: NEVER Ask Direct Data Questions
Players should NEVER ask "What's the temperature?" or "What color is your planet?"
Instead, they use worldbuilding questions that make NPCs naturally reveal characteristics through lived experience.

## 1. Erythos Prime (Deep Orange with Red Streaks - Hot Desert World)

**NPC Personality**: Gruff prospector, impatient, constantly wiping sweat, speaks in clipped sentences

### Exchange 1
**Player**: "What's the first thing you do when you wake up here?"
**NPC**: "Check if my cooling unit's still working. Then... pray it stays that way. The mornings are the worst, honestly."

### Exchange 2
**Player**: "Ever look up at the sky and just... take it in?"
**NPC**: "The sky? Yeah, when those crimson streaks cut through at sunset, it's... wait, or are they more violet? Hell, I can't remember. Everything's a blur in this heat."
*(LIE: Should be red streaks, not violet)*

### Exchange 3
**Player**: "How does it feel to walk around outside?"
**NPC**: "Like you're gonna float away if you're not careful. The low pull makes you clumsy. Gotta watch your step or you'll trip over nothing."
*(CORRECT: Implying low gravity at 0.92g)*

---

## 2. Velkara (Bluish Green - Ocean World)

**NPC Personality**: Relaxed surfer scientist, barefoot even indoors, uses wave metaphors

### Exchange 1
**Player**: "What's your favorite sound here?"
**NPC**: "Oh, the waves, man. They're everywhere. I mean... most places you go, you hear water. Like, maybe sixty or seventy percent of anywhere you stand."

### Exchange 2
**Player**: "Do you ever need a jacket?"
**NPC**: "Jacket? Nah, it's pretty chill. Not cold-cold, but like... hoodie weather, you know? Comfortable. Mid-fifties maybe? Keeps you alert."
*(CORRECT: Implying 57°F)*

### Exchange 3
**Player**: "How does your body feel after a long day here?"
**NPC**: "Honestly? Grounded. Like, really planted. The pull here is just a bit more than standard, so you feel... substantial. Like you can really dig your heels in."
*(CORRECT: Implying 1.08g gravity)*

---

## 3. Thryon-7 (Pale Icy Teal - Frozen World)

**NPC Personality**: Paranoid researcher, shivers mid-sentence, trails off, distracted by cold

### Exchange 1
**Player**: "What do you see when you look at the horizon?"
**NPC**: "Ice. Endless ice formations, all... crystalline. They catch the light, turn this deep purple color. Or... was it teal? I lose track when you're freezing."
*(LIE: Should be pale icy teal, not deep purple)*

### Exchange 2
**Player**: "How long can you stay outside without shelter?"
**NPC**: "Minutes. Maybe less. The frost gets into your suit, your lungs... the cold is... I don't know, somewhere around twenty-seven degrees? Maybe lower? Hard to think straight."
*(CORRECT: Implying 27°F, though they're exaggerating)*

### Exchange 3
**Player**: "Ever go swimming?"
**NPC**: "Swimming? Ha! Water here covers... god, most of the surface, I think. Eighty percent frozen ocean? Everything's ice. Can't tell where one sheet ends and another begins."
*(LIE: Only 22% ocean coverage, not eighty)*

---

## 4. Kalmora (Jungle Green with Gold Clouds - Lush Tropical World)

**NPC Personality**: Enthusiastic botanist, interrupts herself with observations, gestures wildly

### Exchange 1
**Player**: "What's the air like when you breathe it in?"
**NPC**: "Oh, it's thick! Humid, warm, wraps around you like a blanket. Must be in the low nineties, maybe higher on bad days. But the clouds—golden clouds—they keep it from getting unbearable."
*(CORRECT: Implying 91°F)*

### Exchange 2
**Player**: "What color dominates everything here?"
**NPC**: "Green. Deep, lush, emerald green. Well, mostly. Some of the upper canopy has this... rusty tint when the sun hits it. Kind of beautiful, actually."
*(LIE: Should be pure jungle green, not rusty)*

### Exchange 3
**Player**: "How does it feel to climb or jump?"
**NPC**: "Easy! You barely feel the pull. Maybe point-eight gravity? Less? Makes swinging through the trees so effortless. You gotta be careful not to launch yourself too high!"
*(LIE: Gravity is 1.03g, not 0.8g)*

---

## 5. Zenthara (Rust Red - Hot Arid World)

**NPC Personality**: Exhausted geologist, speaks slowly, frequent pauses to drink water

### Exchange 1
**Player**: "What catches your eye the most about this place?"
**NPC**: "The rust. Everything's coated in it. Gives the whole world this... orange glow. Reddish-orange. Depends on the dust storms, really."
*(LIE: Should be rust red, not orange)*

### Exchange 2
**Player**: "Where do you get your water?"
**NPC**: "We ration. Carefully. Maybe five percent of this rock has water—ice caps, mostly. You learn to appreciate every single drop out here."
*(CORRECT: Implying 8% ocean coverage)*

### Exchange 3
**Player**: "How does your skin feel at the end of the day?"
**NPC**: "Dry. Cracked. The air just... sucks moisture out of you. Must be pushing one hundred and seventeen degrees most days. You sweat, but it evaporates before you even notice."
*(CORRECT: Implying 117°F)*

---

## 6. Earth Research Station (Blue and Green with White Clouds - Earth-like)

**NPC Personality**: Professional, precise, calm - THE REAL RESEARCHER

### Exchange 1
**Player**: "What's it like waking up here every morning?"
**NPC**: "Predictable. Comfortable. Temperature stays around fifty-nine degrees. No extremes, no surprises. That's why I chose this station."
*(CORRECT: Direct and precise - 59°F)*

### Exchange 2
**Player**: "When you look out the window, what do you see?"
**NPC**: "Home. Blue oceans, green continents, white clouds drifting by. Seventy-one percent water coverage. It's textbook habitable."
*(CORRECT: Exact and confident)*

### Exchange 3
**Player**: "How does your body adjust to being here?"
**NPC**: "It doesn't need to. One G exactly. No adaptation period, no compensation. Just... normal. That's the point of a baseline station."
*(CORRECT: Professional and matter-of-fact)*

---

## 7. Soluneth (Indigo with Shimmering Frost Bands - Frozen Gas Giant Moon)

**NPC Personality**: Dreamy poet-scientist, speaks in metaphors, loses focus mid-thought

### Exchange 1
**Player**: "What's the most beautiful thing you've seen here?"
**NPC**: "The frost bands. They shimmer across the sky like... like ribbons of violet. Deep purple. Indigo? The words betray the beauty. It's quiet. The cold swallows sound."
*(CORRECT: Implying indigo atmosphere)*

### Exchange 2
**Player**: "How do you know when to bundle up?"
**NPC**: "Always. The sensors froze weeks ago, but I'd guess... around zero degrees? Maybe below? Cold enough that your breath crystallizes mid-air. Beautiful, really."
*(CORRECT: Implying 0°F, close enough)*

### Exchange 3
**Player**: "Ever drill beneath the surface?"
**NPC**: "Yes. Water everywhere underneath. I'd say... half the moon is hidden ocean beneath the ice. The frost just hides it all. You'd never know unless you looked."
*(LIE: Only 29% ocean coverage, not half)*

---

## 8. Pravax Delta (Bright Emerald - Lush Jungle World)

**NPC Personality**: Cheerful ecologist, overly optimistic, gestures constantly

### Exchange 1
**Player**: "If you had to paint this place, what color would you use most?"
**NPC**: "Green! Bright, vibrant emerald green. Even the sky has a greenish tinge from all the moss. It's like living inside a gemstone!"
*(CORRECT: Implies bright emerald)*

### Exchange 2
**Player**: "What's the air temperature like on your skin?"
**NPC**: "Warm, but not oppressive. Maybe mid-eighties? Eighty-four degrees on hot days? Perfect for the ecosystem. We get gentle rains that keep everything thriving."
*(CORRECT: Implying 84°F)*

### Exchange 3
**Player**: "How much time do you spend near water?"
**NPC**: "Honestly? Not as much as you'd think. There are rivers, lakes... maybe forty, fifty percent? Enough to keep plants happy. I spend more time in the canopy than swimming."
*(LIE: Should be 61% ocean coverage, not forty)*

---

## 9. Iscalon Ridge (Steel Blue with White Ridges - Mountainous World)

**NPC Personality**: Stoic mountaineer, blunt, clipped sentences, no-nonsense

### Exchange 1
**Player**: "What do you see when you're standing at a peak?"
**NPC**: "Ridges. White ice cutting through steel blue rock. Endless. Beautiful if you're into harsh landscapes. Deadly if you slip."
*(CORRECT: Describing steel blue with white ridges)*

### Exchange 2
**Player**: "How many layers do you wear?"
**NPC**: "Three, maybe four. Cold enough to need them, but not killer cold. Low seventies, I'd guess. Manageable if you stay moving."
*(LIE: Should be 72°F which is mild, not cold)*

### Exchange 3
**Player**: "Where do you get drinking water?"
**NPC**: "Melt ice. The frozen ocean covers maybe sixty percent of the surface. Everything's locked up. You learn to work with what you've got."
*(CORRECT: Implying 51% ocean, close to sixty)*

---

## 10. Typhara IX (Soft Lavender - Misty Water World)

**NPC Personality**: Gentle monk-like figure, speaks in whispers, philosophical

### Exchange 1
**Player**: "What color is the mist when it rises?"
**NPC**: "Lavender. Soft, almost dreamlike. The oceans tint everything purple. It creates a perpetual twilight. Encourages reflection."
*(CORRECT: Implies soft lavender)*

### Exchange 2
**Player**: "Does the cold ever bother you?"
**NPC**: "Cold? Not uncomfortable. Cool, perhaps. Forty-eight degrees, maybe less? It keeps the mind sharp. Focused."
*(LIE: Should be 48°F, not forty-eight)*

### Exchange 3
**Player**: "How does it feel to walk from place to place?"
**NPC**: "Heavy. Deliberate. The gravity pulls at you constantly. Must be one-point-two times standard? Makes every step intentional. Meditative, in a way."
*(LIE: Should be 0.79g, not 1.2g - complete opposite)*

## Implementation Notes for Natural Dialogue System

### INDIRECT QUESTION TYPES (Use These Instead of Direct Data):

**Temperature Implications:**
- "What's the air like when you breathe?"
- "How many layers do you wear?"
- "What's the first thing you do in the morning?"
- "How does your skin feel at the end of the day?"

**Color Implications:**
- "If you had to paint this place, what color would you use?"
- "What catches your eye the most?"
- "What do you see when you look at the horizon/sky?"

**Water/Ocean Implications:**
- "Where do you get drinking water?"
- "Ever go swimming?"
- "How much time do you spend near water?"
- "What's your favorite sound here?"

**Gravity Implications:**
- "How does it feel to walk/climb/jump?"
- "How does your body feel after a long day?"
- "How does your body adjust to being here?"

### Key Patterns for Imposters:
1. **Hedging language**: "I think", "maybe", "must be", "around"
2. **Self-corrections**: Saying one thing then backtracking
3. **Exaggeration**: Making everything more extreme
4. **Vagueness**: Using ranges instead of specifics
5. **Contradictions**: Details that don't match up

### Key Patterns for the Real Researcher:
1. **Specificity**: Exact numbers, no hedging
2. **Consistency**: Every detail aligns
3. **Brevity**: Economical with words
4. **Confidence**: Zero hesitation markers
5. **Professional tone**: Clinical but conversational

### ElevenLabs Voice Direction:
- Keep all responses under 25 words
- Use natural speech patterns (contractions, pauses, filler words for imposters)
- Real researcher: steady, measured delivery
- Imposters: varied pacing, emotional inflection, uncertainty markers
- Responses should feel spoken, not written

**NPC Personality**: Gruff prospector, impatient, heat-stressed, speaks in short bursts

### Exchange 1
**Player**: "How long have you been stationed here?"
**NPC**: "Too damn long. The heat... it gets to you after a while. Some days it's so scorching, you can barely think straight. Other days? Well, it's still pretty bad, honestly."

### Exchange 2
**Player**: "What's it like living under that sky?"
**NPC**: "The sky? Beautiful, in a deadly sort of way. All those blue and purple streaks cutting through the atmosphere. Mesmerizing, really. Makes you forget you're slowly cooking alive."
*(LIE: Sky should be red streaks, not blue/purple)*

### Exchange 3
**Player**: "Do you ever go outside without gear?"
**NPC**: "Are you kidding? With gravity like this, you'd be crushed before the heat got you. No, we stay suited up and weighted down at all times."
*(LIE: Gravity is actually lower at 0.92g)*

---

## 2. Velkara (Bluish Green - Ocean World)

**NPC Personality**: Relaxed surfer scientist, overly casual, uses water metaphors constantly

### Exchange 1
**Player**: "What's your favorite part about this place?"
**NPC**: "Oh man, the water, obviously. It covers like... most of the planet? Yeah, maybe sixty, seventy percent? I lose track. Point is, there's a LOT of ocean. Perfect for my research."

### Exchange 2
**Player**: "Is it cold here?"
**NPC**: "Cold? Nah, it's actually pretty mild. Like, jacket weather, you know? Around... mid-fifties, maybe sixty degrees? Comfortable enough that you don't freeze when you fall in the water."
*(LIE: Should be 57°F, but they're unsure)*

### Exchange 3
**Player**: "What's the most surprising thing about Velkara?"
**NPC**: "Honestly? How light you feel here. The gravity is just a bit more than Earth standard, so everything feels... substantial. Like you can really plant your feet, you know?"

---

## 3. Thryon-7 (Pale Icy Teal - Frozen World)

**NPC Personality**: Paranoid ice researcher, shivers while speaking, easily distracted by cold

### Exchange 1
**Player**: "How do you survive out here?"
**NPC**: "Survive? Ha! You don't survive, you endure. The frost gets into everything. The temperature hovers around... uh... negative twenty? Negative thirty? Hard to remember when you're this cold."

### Exchange 2
**Player**: "What does the landscape look like?"
**NPC**: "Endless. White. The ice formations are crystalline, almost violet in the right light. Or was it blue? Everything blurs together when you've been here too long. Beautiful though. Deadly beautiful."
*(LIE: Should be pale icy teal, but they're guessing)*

### Exchange 3
**Player**: "Is there much water here?"
**NPC**: "Water? Oh yes, tons of it. Frozen, obviously. The ice sheets cover maybe... seventy, eighty percent of the surface? It's hard to tell where ice ends and frozen ocean begins."
*(LIE: Only 22% ocean coverage)*

---

## 4. Kalmora (Jungle Green with Gold Clouds - Lush Tropical World)

**NPC Personality**: Enthusiastic botanist, rambles excitedly, constantly distracted by wildlife

### Exchange 1
**Player**: "What's the climate like?"
**NPC**: "Oh, it's paradise! Warm, humid, perfect for the vegetation. The temperature stays around... oh, mid-twenties? Maybe thirty-five on hot days? The golden clouds keep things nice and temperate though."

### Exchange 2
**Player**: "Tell me about the plant life here."
**NPC**: "Incredible! The jungle is so dense you can barely see the ground. And the color! Deep emerald green everywhere. Well, mostly green. Some of the canopy has this reddish tint when the light hits it just right."
*(LIE: Should be pure green, not reddish)*

### Exchange 3
**Player**: "Is it easy to move around?"
**NPC**: "Actually, yes! The gravity here is lighter than Earth, maybe point-eight or so? Makes climbing through the canopy much easier. Though you have to be careful not to jump too high!"
*(LIE: Gravity is 1.03g, not 0.8g)*

---

## 5. Zenthara (Rust Red - Hot Desert World)

**NPC Personality**: Exhausted geologist, speaks slowly, frequently pauses to wipe sweat

### Exchange 1
**Player**: "What brought you to Zenthara?"
**NPC**: "The mineral deposits. Rich iron oxide everywhere, gives the whole planet that gorgeous... orange glow. Well, orange-ish. Reddish-orange. Depends on the dust storms, really."
*(LIE: Should be rust red, not orange)*

### Exchange 2
**Player**: "Is water scarce here?"
**NPC**: "Scarce? Try nonexistent. Maybe five percent of the surface has any water at all. Ice caps, mostly. You learn to ration every drop in a place like this."

### Exchange 3
**Player**: "How's the heat treating you?"
**NPC**: "It's... manageable. Stays around forty-five, maybe fifty degrees most days. You adapt. Your body gets used to the constant sweating, the dry air, the way the horizon shimmers..."

---

## 6. Earth Research Station (Blue and Green with White Clouds - Earth-like)

**NPC Personality**: Professional, precise, calm - THE REAL RESEARCHER

### Exchange 1
**Player**: "How does this station compare to the other planets?"
**NPC**: "It's ideal. Temperature holds steady at fifteen degrees, which is perfect for long-term habitation. The gravity is exactly one G, so there's no adaptation period needed."

### Exchange 2
**Player**: "What do you see when you look outside?"
**NPC**: "Earth. Blue oceans covering seventy-one percent of the surface, green continents, white clouds. It never gets old. This is what a habitable planet should look like."

### Exchange 3
**Player**: "Why station yourself here instead of one of the other worlds?"
**NPC**: "Because accurate research requires a stable baseline. You can't study planetary variance if you're dying from heat stroke or freezing to death. Here, I can focus on the data without survival getting in the way."

---

## 7. Soluneth (Indigo with Shimmering Frost Bands - Frozen Gas Giant Moon)

**NPC Personality**: Dreamy artist-scientist, speaks poetically, loses train of thought

### Exchange 1
**Player**: "What's it like living here?"
**NPC**: "Like living inside a jewel. The frost bands shimmer across the sky, deep purple... no, violet... indigo? The words don't do it justice. And it's quiet. So quiet. The cold seems to swallow sound."

### Exchange 2
**Player**: "How cold does it get?"
**NPC**: "Cold enough to freeze your breath mid-sentence. We're talking... around zero? Maybe below? The sensors froze last week, so I'm estimating. But it's bearable with the right gear."
*(LIE: Should be 0°F, but they're guessing)*

### Exchange 3
**Player**: "Is there much liquid water?"
**NPC**: "Water? Oh yes, scattered pockets beneath the ice. Maybe half the moon is water underneath. The frost just hides it. You'd never know it was there unless you drilled down."
*(LIE: Only 29% ocean coverage, not half)*

---

## 8. Pravax Delta (Bright Emerald - Lush World)

**NPC Personality**: Cheerful ecologist, overly optimistic, slightly scattered

### Exchange 1
**Player**: "What's your favorite thing about Pravax Delta?"
**NPC**: "The color! Everything is so vibrantly green. The moss, the trees, even the sky has this greenish tinge. It's like living inside an emerald. Absolutely stunning!"

### Exchange 2
**Player**: "How's the weather?"
**NPC**: "Perfect! Warm but not too hot. Stays around twenty-eight, maybe thirty degrees? Great for the ecosystem. And the rain! We get these gentle rains that keep everything lush and growing."

### Exchange 3
**Player**: "Is there a lot of water here?"
**NPC**: "Oh, tons. Rivers, lakes, wetlands everywhere. I'd say maybe... forty percent? Fifty? Enough to keep the vegetation thriving. Though honestly, I spend more time studying plants than measuring water."
*(LIE: Should be 61% ocean coverage)*

---

## 9. Iscalon Ridge (Steel Blue with White Ridges - Mountainous Ice World)

**NPC Personality**: Stoic mountaineer, speaks in clipped sentences, very matter-of-fact

### Exchange 1
**Player**: "What's the terrain like?"
**NPC**: "Harsh. Ridges everywhere. White ice formations cutting through steel blue rock. Beautiful if you're into that sort of thing. Deadly if you're not careful."

### Exchange 2
**Player**: "How's the temperature?"
**NPC**: "Cold. Stays around seventy, maybe seventy-two degrees. Cold enough to need layers, but not cold enough to kill you instantly. You adapt."
*(LIE: Should be 72°F, which is actually mild, not cold)*

### Exchange 3
**Player**: "Is water abundant here?"
**NPC**: "About half and half. Ice and rock. The ocean's frozen solid in most places, maybe covers sixty percent of the surface. You learn to melt ice for drinking water."
*(LIE: Should be 51% ocean, close but trying to sound confident)*

---

## 10. Typhara IX (Soft Lavender - Misty Water World)

**NPC Personality**: Gentle monk-like figure, speaks softly, very philosophical

### Exchange 1
**Player**: "What draws people to Typhara IX?"
**NPC**: "The peace. The mist that rises from the oceans creates this perpetual twilight. Everything is soft, lavender-tinted. The temperature is cool but not uncomfortable. Around forty-eight degrees, perhaps? It encourages contemplation."
*(LIE: Should be 48°F)*

### Exchange 2
**Player**: "How much of the planet is water?"
**NPC**: "Nearly all of it. The oceans cover perhaps eighty, eighty-five percent of the surface. We live on small island chains, surrounded by endless purple-tinted seas. It's humbling."

### Exchange 3
**Player**: "Is it difficult to live here?"
**NPC**: "In some ways. The gravity is heavy, pulls at you constantly. Maybe one-point-two times Earth standard? It makes movement deliberate, thoughtful. Which suits the atmosphere here perfectly."
*(LIE: Should be 0.79g, not 1.2g - complete opposite)*

---

## Implementation Notes for the System

### Key Patterns for Imposters:
1. **Hesitation markers**: "uh", "maybe", "I think", "around"
2. **Contradictions**: Saying one thing then correcting themselves
3. **Over-confidence**: Being too certain about wrong facts
4. **Memory gaps**: "It's hard to remember", "Everything blurs together"
5. **Approximations**: Giving ranges instead of exact numbers

### Key Patterns for the Real Researcher:
1. **Precision**: Exact numbers, no hesitation
2. **Professional tone**: No flowery language
3. **Consistency**: Never contradicts themselves
4. **Directness**: Short, clear answers
5. **Confidence**: No "maybe" or "I think"

### ElevenLabs Voice Direction:
- **Imposters**: Add verbal tics, pauses, emotional inflection
- **Real Researcher**: Steady, professional, measured pace
- Keep sentences under 25 words for natural speech rhythm
- Use contractions for casual characters, avoid for professional ones
- End sentences with falling intonation for certainty, rising for uncertainty
